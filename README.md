## Description

Computer vision is a scientific discipline that has recently made good progress in various sub-areas (e.g. object segmentation, video classification, disease detection), achieving a level of performance that was unexpected just a few years ago. With the advent of new AI techniques, computer vision has opened up possibilities in many real-world domains, including transportation (autonomous cars, drones), and smart cities (disaster monitoring, surveillance systems). Although these applications provide massive meaning and value to this technology, their implementation and teaching in Bolivia are still limited. In contrast, the expansion of the Internet and mobile devices (computer devices connected to the network) in Bolivia offers a unique opportunity for technology communities, made up of software developers, engineers, or students, to become more involved in this field.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of goals posed by the United Nations to achieve sustainable development by 2030 without harnessing living beings and nature. Expanding the scope of computer vision applications to address the SDG goals could lead to the generation of more ideas and solutions that take advantage of this technology, and in this way positively impact the lives of the Bolivian society. For this reason, the Bolivian Catholic University "San Pablo", with the sponsorship of Google AI, launched the program "Bootcamp: Computer Vision for the Sustainable Development Goals", held between March 24 and June 29, 2022. The present repository contains the materials developed during the Bootcamp.
